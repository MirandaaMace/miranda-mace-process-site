						<h1>The Solution</h1>
						<p class="info">Designing a Style Tile was the final step after conducting research and setting an audience.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
						<p>My call to action seeks to invite people to become sponsors and donate. </p>
					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
						<p>I created a Style Tile to help get a general sense of what the future website will look like.</p>
						<div id="Style">
									<img src="/Users/mirandaslaptop/Documents/GitHub/miranda-mace-process-site/images/StyleTile.png" data-position="10% center" />
						</div>
						<p>In this Style Tile, I put together some visuals that would best reflect The HEARTest Yard. I included adjectives that I felt best described the organization
I also chose a color scheme that features. The colors I chose are muted greens and blues and a more vibrant red to be used as an accent. I chose these because they were the original colors of the logo but muted them so they wouldn’t be as overwhelming.
		</p>
						<p>The original logo of The HEARTest Yard was brightly colored and had gradients. I wanted to keep the logo as close to the original as possible because of the symbolism included but wanted to simplify it. The logo features two down indicators used in football turned to make a heart. One is smaller on the left heart side to reference Greg Olsen’s son’s congenital heart disease of the left heart. My solution was to turn the outlines of the original logo white and edit the banners a little bit to avoid tampering with the symbolism.</p>
						<p>For type I chose the typeface Rockwell for titles because it has character that I thought would be consistent with The HEARTest Yard.  Futura Condensed Medium for headers. I used Futura Medium to write out the mission statement, so it stood out more. I also used Futura Book BT as my copy typeface.</p>
