						<h3>Primary Client Research</h3>
								<p>The Heartest Yard is “the first and only family relief program for pediatric cardiovascular patients. The mission is to support families of children with congenital heart disease at the Levine Children’s Hospital. Currently, The Heartest Yard does not have its own website, but has single pages on The Panther’s website, Levine Children’s Hospital’s website, Showmars website, and The Greg Olsen Foundation website. Each of these pages offers different information that could be easier to maneuver if they were all on the same site.</p>
							<h4>Levine Children’s Hospital’s Website</h4>
								<p>This page features a brief overview of the organization, links to pages with two different featured CHD stories, a video, and a donate now button.</p>
							<h4>Showmars Website</h4>
								<p>Showmars is a chain restaurant that is common in Charlotte. This site features brief information about The Heartest Yard 5k and a link to the runningsignup.com page where runners and volunteers sign up.</p>
							<h4>Receptions for Research Website</h4>
								<p>The Greg Olsen Foundation, ReceptionsforResearch.com, features one page dedicated to the Heartest Yard and a link page with news articles about the organization. The website also has a donate now button.</p>
							<h4>The Carolina Panther’s Website</h4>
								<p>Greg Olsen was a member of the Carolina Panthers team. He was traded this year and is now a member of the Seahawks. However, The Heartest Yard is still active helping children with congenital heart disease and their families in Charlotte. This page on the Panther’s site features a photo gallery from the 5k.</p>
