						<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
								<p>The Heartest Yard is “the first and only family relief program for pediatric cardiovascular patients. The mission is to support families of children with congenital heart disease at the Levine Children’s Hospital. Currently, The Heartest Yard does not have its own website, but has single pages on The Panther’s website, Levine Children’s Hospital’s website, Showmars website, and The Greg Olsen Foundation website. Each of these pages offers different information that could be easier to maneuver if they were all on the same site.</p>
							<h4>Levine Children’s Hospital’s Website</h4>
								<p>This page features a brief overview of the organization, links to pages with two different featured CHD stories, a video featuring Greg Olsen, and a donate button that is at the bottom. This page is associated with the hospital to give brief information about the cause, but has no information on how to get involved in the community or be a part of events.</p>

							<h4>Showmars Website</h4>
								<p>Showmars is a chain restaurant that is common in Charlotte that partners with the HEARTest Yard to put on a 5k to raise money. This site features brief information about The Heartest Yard 5k and a link to the runningsignup.com page where runners and volunteers sign up.</p>

							<h4>Receptions for Research Website</h4>
								<p>The Greg Olsen Foundation, ReceptionsforResearch.com, features one page dedicated to the Heartest Yard and a link page with news articles about the organization. The website also has a donate now button.</p>

							<h4>The Carolina Panther’s Website</h4>
								<p>Greg Olsen was a member of the Carolina Panthers team. He was traded this year and is now a member of the Seahawks. However, The Heartest Yard is still active helping children with congenital heart disease and their families in Charlotte. This page on the Panther’s site features a photo gallery from the 5k.</p>

					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
						<p>Through secondary research I looked for organizations similar to The HEARTest Yard.
I didn’t see anything that was exactly like it, but I came across a couple organizations that deal with education and learning needs within the hospital similar to what the The HEARTest Yard raises money to support.</p>
						<h4>Curesearch.org</h4>
							<p>Curesearch is an organization that helps children in the hospital with educational needs. This organization actively gives help to hospitalized students while the HEARTest Yard provides the funds for a program like this through the hospital in Charlotte.<p/>

								</div>
						<h4>Corience.org</h4>
							<p>Corience is a European organization that gives information on what it means to live life with a congenital heart defect. This organization gives information but does not offer any in-person resources.</p>
							<div class="02Corience">

					<h2>Interviews</h2>
					<h3>Interview with The HEARTest Yard</h3>
						<p>From my interview with social media manager of The HEARTest Yard I learned that the logo has a lot of symbolism. The down markers form a heart which relates to Greg Olsen, the founder’s, background in NFL Football. The left heart is smaller which relates to TJ’s, Greg Olsen’s son’s, Left Hypoplastic Heart Syndrome. I learned that The HEARTest Yard Showmars 5k only happens once a year, typically in the spring. During other times of the year, they encourage donations and attending the other small events they host like pop up shops. It’s about raising money to help kids in Charlotte with congenital heart defects succeed in life, but it’s about community as well. I also learned that through this organization, Levine Children’s Hospital is building a new “Cardiac Center” through the help of The HEARTest Yard and recently they did a partnership with a Chipotle in Charlotte to help raise money.</p>
					<h3>Interview with a Runner</h3>
						<p>From my interview with a runner, my brother answered my questions about how and why he signs up for races. Overall, when he uses a website for running, he likes to know a little bit about what he is running for, but the main reason he would go to the site would be to find information on the race. For him, the most important thing would be that the race information is easily accessible. He most likely wouldn’t pay attention to much else except for some brief information on the cause. He also said he would probably find out about the race on a different running site that shows the 5ks coming up as that site lets him see which one is closest and works in his time frame.</p>
					<h3>Interview with a Heart Kid</h3>
						<p>I interviewed Kelsey McCourt who was born with a CHD and Scoliosis. Kelsey told me about what it’s like to be in and out of the hospital throughout childhood and how missing school and other events impacted her. Kelsey is not currently a part of The HEARTest Yard community but heard about it from the hospital and the camp she goes to. She is interested in learning more about the organization and possibly becoming a part of the community. A website would definitely help her achieve her goal of gaining more information. </p>
