						<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
								<p>The Heartest Yard is “the first and only family relief program for pediatric cardiovascular patients. The mission is to support families of children with congenital heart disease at the Levine Children’s Hospital. Currently, The Heartest Yard does not have its own website, but has single pages on The Panther’s website, Levine Children’s Hospital’s website, Showmars website, and The Greg Olsen Foundation website. Each of these pages offers different information that could be easier to maneuver if they were all on the same site.</p>
							<h4>Levine Children’s Hospital’s Website</h4>
								<p>This page features a brief overview of the organization, links to pages with two different featured CHD stories, a video featuring Greg Olsen, and a donate button that is at the bottom. This page is associated with the hospital to give brief information about the cause, but has no information on how to get involved in the community or be a part of events.</p>

							<h4>Showmars Website</h4>
								<p>Showmars is a chain restaurant that is common in Charlotte that partners with the HEARTest Yard to put on a 5k to raise money. This site features brief information about The Heartest Yard 5k and a link to the runningsignup.com page where runners and volunteers sign up.</p>

							<h4>Receptions for Research Website</h4>
								<p>The Greg Olsen Foundation, ReceptionsforResearch.com, features one page dedicated to the Heartest Yard and a link page with news articles about the organization. The website also has a donate now button.</p>

							<h4>The Carolina Panther’s Website</h4>
								<p>Greg Olsen was a member of the Carolina Panthers team. He was traded this year and is now a member of the Seahawks. However, The Heartest Yard is still active helping children with congenital heart disease and their families in Charlotte. This page on the Panther’s site features a photo gallery from the 5k.</p>

					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
						<p>Through secondary research I looked for organizations similar to The HEARTest Yard.
I didn’t see anything that was exactly like it, but I came across a couple organizations that deal with education and learning needs within the hospital similar to what the The HEARTest Yard raises money to support.</p>
						<h4>Curesearch.org</h4>
							<p>Curesearch is an organization that helps children in the hospital with educational needs. This organization actively gives help to hospitalized students while the HEARTest Yard provides the funds for a program like this through the hospital in Charlotte.<p/>

								</div>
						<h4>Corience.org</h4>
							<p>Corience is a European organization that gives information on what it means to live life with a congenital heart defect. This organization gives information but does not offer any in-person resources.</p>
