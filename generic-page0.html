						<p class="info"> I did primary research on the Heartest Yard. Then conducted secondary research.</p>
					</header>
						<h3>Primary Research</h3>
							<p>The HEARTest Yard assists families as they settle into their new lives as parents of children with congenital heart disease. The services are deducted from predetermined medical benefit and are used at the family’s discretion. The program is an extension of the world-class-medical care offered at Levine Children’s Hospital, but at no cost to the family.
The goal of the program is to improve the morality rate, increase life expectancy and better the long-term prognosis for pediatric heart patients.</p>
							<p>The concept of heart kids getting left behind because of their time in the hospital is something that The Heartest Yard is trying to change. Kids have other needs than just their heart defects like education, speech therapy, developmental and emotional needs. It is important that while they are being taken care of physically that the other aspects of their life don’t suffer so when they are physically better they aren’t left behind.</p>
							<p>Greg and Kara Olson have a lot to share about Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome and are passionate about assisting other families affected by congenital heart disease. You're invited to join them in their pursuit to give pediatric heart babies a second chance at life.</p>
