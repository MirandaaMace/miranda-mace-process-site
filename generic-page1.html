						<h1>Audience & Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After conducting research, I identified an audience for my website along with goals that the website is trying to achieve. </p>
					</header>
					<h3>Audience</h3>
					<div class="row">
							<p>To figue out the audience that the website should be tailored towards, I completed this sticky note exercise to help visualize the groups of people.</p>
							<p>I used sticky notes to visually arrange the groups. I originally had a third blue sticky note that said “Website Viewers” but after moving things around over and over I determined that that sticky note didn’t quite fit. </p>
							<p>Under Event Participants I listed six groups. Friends of heart families, heart families, hospital staff, volunteers, runners, and supporters. These are the people who will actively participate in the community.</p>
							<p>Under Donors and Sponsors, I listed three groups of people which included; sports fans of Greg Olsen, Companies, and People who have heard about the organization through social media or the news or by other means.</p>

														<h3>Conclusion</h3>
															<p>Overall, the goal through this website is to raise money for the cause through donors and events while growing the community. Through the funds, The HEARTest Yard can help children with their educational needs while they are stuck in the hospital. The audience's goal is to donate or register for an event while becoming a part of the community. Through joining forces with The HEARTest Yard, the audience will be making a difference while becoming a part of something bigger than themselves.</p>
															<p>Through my research, I have come to the conclusion that The HEARTest Yard will be able to achieve more of their goals through having a website of their own. All of their information will be in one place, the audience will be able to get a clear idea of what the organization stands for as well as all the information involved in becoming a part of the community.</p>
