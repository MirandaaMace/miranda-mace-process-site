					<h3>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</h3>
					<h3>Now, Frame it as a design question.</h3>
					     <p>How would a website for The HEARTest Yard help raise awareness for CHD and help CHD children?<p/>
					<h3>What is the impact you're trying to have?</h3>
					     <p>Increase in donations and participation in events to help children with CHDs in Charlotte.</p>
					<h3>What are some possible solutions to the problem?</h3>
					     <p>An easily accessible and approachable website. Appeal to donors, participants, and heart families and provide information.</p>
					<h3>Context and Restraints?</h3>
					     <p>It’s a small organization that partners with Levine Children’s Hospital in CLT and with the Greg Olson Foundation; R4R. It might be difficult to get information from them because it is spread across several groups and organizations. Also, Greg Olson is moving to a different football team outside of CLT which could impact the organization.</p>
					<h3>Restating the Design Question.</h3>
